Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming.

29. Where can I go to see a web pages’ requests and their statuses?

We would use a media query to make the page responsive the different devices. 

31. What can I use in a browser to ensure a website looks good on mobile and desktop?

Two conditions if/else and switch statement. 

40. What’s one thing I can use to help me debug my code?

console.log can help us debug our code. 
Debugger
